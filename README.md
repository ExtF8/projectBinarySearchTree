# Binary Search Trees

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees) and it focuses on implementing a basic binary search tree (BST) data structure in JavaScript.<br/> A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure that stores elements in a sorted manner, allowing for efficient search, and deletion operations.

### Features

-   Insert: Add a new node with a given value.
-   Delete: Remove node with a specified value.
-   Find: Search for a node with a given value.
-   In-order: Traverse in ascending order of node values.
-   Pre-order: Traverse by visiting the current node before its children.
-   Post-order: Traverse by visiting the current node after its children.
-   Level-order: Traverse level by level, from left to right.
-   Height: Calculate the height of the binary search tree.
-   Depth: Calculate the depth of a given node in the binary search tree.
-   Balance check: Check if the tree is balanced.
-   Rebalance: Reconstruct the tree to achieve balance.

### Technologies Used

-   JavaScript (ES6)
-   Node.js (for running JavaScript code)

## Usage

To get started with the Binary Search Trees project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:ExtF8/projectBinarySearchTree.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd projectBinarySearchTree
    ```
3. Running Tests:

-   The `script.js` file contains test cases for the BST implementation.
-   To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
-   This command will execute the test script and display the results in the console.
-   You can modify the `script.js` file to add or customize test cases as needed.
